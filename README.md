Practicing statistical research and analysis with Football Statistics using the nflfastR package

## File Contents
First Drive Summary - R File which uses the package nflfastR and other packages to download play by play game data from the NFL (includes seasons 2000-2023). It takes a look into team statistics and also summarizes each team's first drive results during the 2023 season
