## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# PLAY BY PLAY 
## This will load all play by play data into a data frame called pbp there are over 40,000 rows with 372 columns this is for only 2023. For more data use (2000:2023).

```{r}
pbp <- load_pbp(2001:2023)

#write.csv(pbp, "C:\\Users\\mikey\\OneDrive\\Documents\\Madden\\pbp", row.names=FALSE)
```

## GAME SUMMARY

### Trying to create a game summary that will allow us to roll up to player and teams stats for careers single season. Currently needs more columns to track players and should be changed to drive summary and then rolled up to game data.

```{r}

# Game Summary

## Using this as a way to understand teams record for spread and over/unders. Not really useful for models.

```{r}
